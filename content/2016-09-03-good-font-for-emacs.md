Spacemacs recommends using source code pro as the default font, infact this is the font set in ```.spacemacs``` file. If the font is not availale it is sbustituted for somether alternative.
To find the font in use do ```C-u C-x =``` on my mac it was using Menlo font. DejavuSansMono looks better than Source code Pro on ubuntu and I switched to use it in my ubuntu system.
A list of top programming fonts can be found at [[Top programming fonts] https://github.com/hbin/top-programming-fonts]

Installation of a ubuntu system is easy, copy all the ```<fontnames>.ttf``` to ```~/.fonts``` folder and then update cache using ```fc-cahce -f```. 
To get the list of installed fonts use ```fc-list```
