   I have been thinking about having a professional looking blog/space for
   some time. I noticed many people I follow on github maintaining a
   neat blog, I see that many of them
   use <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll<a>/
        <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> and use
  <a href="http://pages.github.com/"> github pages</a> for hosting. I like the concept of static blogging and
   wanted to give it a try.

    I gone through the process and it looks neat and clean, create a
    github repo with your username and drop html pages into it and <a href="http://www.github.com/"> github</a> takes care of serving them,
    damm simple. Can't wait to write my blog and here comes the first
    posts. I will be tweaking my comments setup with <a href="http://disqus.com/"> disqus</a> and
    analytics and also my blog engine using this post.
